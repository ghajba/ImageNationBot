## Features

* add/list/remove wallets
    * works only with Cardano wallets and ADAHandles

* context menu to show some user related information

## Future features

* make the bot work with multiple servers

* bot setup for owners (currently, you have to set up the managed policies and their roles through the database with
  manual effort)
